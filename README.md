`Currently Only supports Windows though it should be straightforward to port it to GNU/Linux.`

This is a wrapper for OpenHaptics geared towards Unity3D. This plugin is under development. 

## Supports:
- Sphere rendering
- Gravity well rendering

### Build requirements:
* Cmake (unless you want to make a project manually)
* [OpenHaptics](https://support.3dsystems.com/s/article/OpenHaptics-for-Windows-Developer-Edition-v35?language=en_US) by 3DS (which, ironically, is closed source). The build system will try to locate the header and library files under $(OH_SDK_BASE) Environment variable in Windows.
* (`Optional`) Set Environment Variable Unity_Plugins_Folder and uncomment the bottom of CMakeLists.txt to make the build system automatically copy the built library to your Assets/Plugins folder.

### To use in Unity 3D:
- Copy the built plugin to your Assets/Plugins folder (or make the build system automatically do it for you - see CMakelists.txt)
- Create a new c# script that inherits from :Haptic
- Implement OnStylusButtonDown method
- (Optional) use stopCallback and startSphereCallback(...) to add a sphere and test your haptic device.
- Press Play

### Customize
- Both the haptic plugin source and the Unity3D haptic class source are self-explanatory.
- Due to Unity3D/Mono limitations, if you make changes to the C/C++ library you must completely close and restart unity to load the new build of the .dll.
- Feel free to open an issue with feature requests
